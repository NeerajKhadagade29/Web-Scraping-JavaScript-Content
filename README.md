# Web-Scraping-JavaScript-Content
This is a part of a blog post written by me on web scraping. Please refer to the Medium Blog for explanations.

Data Collection is one of main steps in building machine learning models (or even for market research, per se). There are various methods to collect data, like using APIs, first-party, third-party data, manual extraction, and data from sources like Government entities, and newspapers, to name a few.
One of the most efficient ways to collect data from the internet is web scraping. Ofcource, there are challenges involved, but there are solutions to overcome them.

I have used Python for this implementation. The challenge I faced was extracting data present in a JavaScript Tag. As I told you if there are challenges, there are solutions as well.

Hence, I have written this blog as a two-part series, to discuss how I overcame the challenge of extracting data from a JavaScript tag. I hope my knowledge and experience will help you as well.
